## Features

### Gameplay Mechanics

#### Rules
The main rules of this game are to survive for 40 years until you reach the promise land.  This includes helping the people of the 12 tribes.  In order for you to be allowed in to the promise land you need to reach the last turn (40 turns) with a Piety score of at least 90/100.  (Player testing is needed for balance)
 
#### Events
The events that happened historically during the Exodus will be close to what happens in the game while you are trying to survive.  Such as reaching a water source, sickness, starvation, Manna (food) found all over the place from seemingly no where.
 
#### Game Play Loops
A single play session (“Called a TURN”) will start with the player looking at their inventory and figuring out who they can help.  People will be hungry and thirsty and some of them will need help.
 
After helping people with your inventory.  The player will have a chance to gather more manna, pray, create objects from wood or cloth, or simply keep walking.
 
After the player has done all of their tasks and helped who they can.  The player will then be able to level up their Piety based on how well they did in each turn.
 
They will do this by using the points that they have earned (Much like gaining Points for deeds).
 
Inventory will allow players to carry more or craft better items.
 
Then the next turn is able to begin.

#### Options During Each Turn

* Pray:  (Piety +1).  This will not end the player turn but will be a single act during each turn.  Each time the player uses this option they will gain 1 Piety. 
* Heal Sick:  (Inventory -1 Medicine) (Piety +1).  This will only be available if the player has acquired at least one medicine in their inventory.  This can be from trading or by crafting the item.  The player is able to craft 1 medicine if they have the required herbs.
	This option will also be available without taking up the entire turn.
* Feed Hungry:  (Inventory -1 Manna) (Piety +1).  This will only be available if the player has at least 1 Manna in their inventory.  They will be able to gather Manna or trade for it.
	This option will not take up the entire turn.
 
*	Gather Manna:  (Inventory +1 Manna).  This will be available in the areas where Manna is found on the ground.  This will not happen every turn.  So the player will need to keep an eye on this option when it pops up.
*	Eat Manna:  (Health increases Full) (Manna -1).  Player health will fall each turn unless they eat Manna on each turn.  They only need to choose this option once per turn in order to recover health.  Doing this option will restore health and will NOT take up the player turn.
 
*	Craft Item:  Any Items created will be added into inventory.  Limited to medicine at launch.  The only catch is that the player will have to focus on crafting so this option will eliminate other options.
	(Player testing to find balance)  and  (New craft items possible after launch)
 
*	Trade:  Item to be traded is removed from inventory, any new item will be added when purchased with gold on hand.
 
*	Keep Walking:  This will end the player turn and show a short 2D animation of walking through the desert toward their next landmark.  This can be a Food source (Manna) or a water source (River).  After the player ends their turn by selecting “Keep Walking” then many things can happen.

 
#### After Each Turn

Each turn consists of an entire year (12 months) so there are a LOT of things that can happen in that time.
If the player has completed each option and raised their Piety for that year then a few things can happen.
 
*	Manna is found:   Some turns will not show any Manna and people will start to starve.  As long as the player has collected enough Manna they can either eat it or share it.  When “Manna is Found” shows up before the next turn then the player will get an option to gather it.
	A random amount will appear in the player inventory that they will be able to share or eat.  Depending on what they choose, their piety will increase or stay the same.
 
*	Craft Items are Made:  During the journey, lots of craftsmen were busy creating clothing and medicines.  The player will also be able to take part in this if they chose to craft items during their turn.  After crafting items the player can trade or sell the items for gold or Manna that they can then use.
 
*	Reaching a Water Source:  This is a random event that will help feed and heal people and reduce the stress of the game.  The player can choose to gather water and help heal people during this time.  A rare chance to increase piety.
 
*	People Dying in the Desert:  When food and water become scarce, people of the 12 tribes will start to die.  The number of people will show up during these times.  You want as many people to arrive at their destination as possible.
*	more...

#### Game Economy
The player will be able to trade the items they create with other people.  Each item created will have a manna price and a gold coin price.  This will help the player acquire things that they would not be able to craft.

 
## The Game World

### Overview

As the game will mainly be text based, there might be a 2D map with regions on it.  This is mainly to show the player how far the 40 years has gotten them before they reach the promise land.
 
### The  Map

#### Look and Feel

The 2D map of the area will be shown with numbered sections much like this “Concept Art” below.  Each number will represent where each turn lands them on the map.  Much like a board game, every turn will move the player along the path.  Random events will happen after each turn has passede.
 
#### Key Locations & Moments

* Tutorial & Intro: The first few turns will consist of explaining how to do each of the tasks and how they reward the player. (Create this last, after all features entered)
 
*	Scripted:  Events in the history of the Exodus will play out in the year they are associated with in the timeline.  These will happen in the player turn that they should happen.  The points on the map will represent these events.
	The path that the player will take is linear and will look similar to the “Concept Art” below.
 
*	Random: People in the tribes will ask for help and offer information that is not part of the main story line.  Also, after each turn happens a random number of people will get sick and a number of people will die.  This will cause the player to make decisions.
 
*	TIPS: (Foreshadow the next event by giving hits about what is going to happen next).
