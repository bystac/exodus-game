# Camp

According to the book of Numbers in the Bible, the Israelites organized their camp in the wilderness in a specific way, with the different tribes arranged in a circular formation around the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary that they used for worship.

The Tabernacle was located in the center of the camp, and the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were positioned on the east side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad were positioned on the south side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin were positioned on the west side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali were positioned on the north side of the Tabernacle.

Each tribe had its own banner or standard, and they were arranged according to their respective banners. The Levites, who were responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Tabernacle, were also positioned around the Tabernacle, with the Kohathites responsible for the most sacred items and the Gershonites and Merarites responsible for the other items.

The arrangement of the camp was intended to facilitate the Israelites' worship of God and to provide a sense of order and unity within the community.

## Pillar of cloud by day / Pillar of fire by night

According to the book of Exodus in the Bible, God provided the Israelites with a cloud to guide them and protect them during their journey through the wilderness. The cloud was known as the "pillar of cloud by day" and the "pillar of fire by night." It would appear over the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary that the Israelites used for worship, and it would move in front of the Israelites as they traveled, indicating the direction that they should go.

The cloud provided the Israelites with protection from the heat of the desert sun during the day and from the cold at night. It also served as a visual representation of God's presence with the Israelites and as a symbol of His guidance and protection.

In addition to the cloud, God also provided the Israelites with other forms of protection during their journey, such as miraculous provision of food and water and protection from their enemies. God also sent angels to guide and protect them, and He gave them victories in battles against other nations and tribes.
