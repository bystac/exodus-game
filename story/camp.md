# Camp

According to the book of Numbers in the Bible, the Israelites organized their camp in the wilderness in a specific way, with the different tribes arranged in a circular formation around the Tabernacle, the portable sanctuary that they used for worship.

The Tabernacle was located in the center of the camp, and the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun were positioned on the east side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad were positioned on the south side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin were positioned on the west side of the Tabernacle. The tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali were positioned on the north side of the Tabernacle.

Each tribe had its own banner or standard, and they were arranged according to their respective banners. The Levites, who were responsible for the maintenance and operation of the Tabernacle, were also positioned around the Tabernacle, with the Kohathites responsible for the most sacred items and the Gershonites and Merarites responsible for the other items.

The arrangement of the camp was intended to facilitate the Israelites' worship of God and to provide a sense of order and unity within the community.
